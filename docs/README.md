# Overview

**Software Checkout** is a Node.js app for libraries and other institutions to allow dynamic request and assignment of software licenses. Users can request license access by signing up for a time-slot using SpringShare's [LibCal](https://www.springshare.com/libcal/); the app then updates license assignments with the vendor's user management API to assign or a revoke licenses at the appropriate time.
